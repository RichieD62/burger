# Eat-Da-Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is an application that allows the user to list all of the juciy burgers he/she would like to devour. The user has the ability to add whatever burger he/she wants and will list them on the page with a "Devour!" button next to it in the *To Be Devoured* section. If the user clicks the "Devour!" button, the burger will move to the *Devoured* section.

This application utilizes Express.js, Express.handlebars, MYSQL and Node.js. To use the application, the user will have to install Node.js (if that is not already installed), and then using his/her terminal, navigate to the folder where the server.js file is located. Once there, the user can type in **node server.js**, and then, using their preferred website browser, he/she can navigate to the local host and begin to use the application.

The biggest challenge that I experienced with this application was developing the ORM and figuring out how to use handlebars. After doing some research on both of the topics, I was able to make the application work.
